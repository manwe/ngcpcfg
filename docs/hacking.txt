Source Layout
-------------

The frontend command ngcpcfg is in _sbin/_. Each of its subcommands are
implemented in _scripts/_.

The _functions/_ directory contains a shell library to be used by the various
shell script commands. The _lib/_ directory contains Template library files
to be used (via the PROCESS directive) by the _*.tt2_ template files. And
the _helper/_ directory contains various helper tools used by the various
scripts and build system.

Templating
----------

Of very significant note here are the 'tt2-daemon' and 'tt2-wrapper' tandem,
which perform most of the work when processing the templates. The daemon is
a long-lived process that gets interacted with via a socket, and receives
"commands" from the 'tt2-wrapper'. The YAML configuration files are loaded
so that they only need to be validated and processed once. And then each
template file to be processed is fed to the daemon and the result returned
via the wrapper. All the configuration loaded from the YAML files is
flattened into a dot-separated namespaced tree, which can be accessed
directly by any template file even if no other code has references to those
configurations.
